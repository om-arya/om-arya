## About Me
I’m pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science at the University of Maryland, College Park, with minors in Math and Statistics. My technical proficiencies cover a broad range, encompassing full-stack web development, mobile development, and machine learning. I'm particularly passionate about leveraging my skills to develop solutions with a real-world impact, crafted with an analytical and user-centric mentality. Always looking forward to new challenges and opportunities, I'm eager to apply my skills as a software engineer in a dynamic and innovative environment. When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me playing guitar, reading, playing/watching sports (or a Bollywood movie), or just hanging out with friends and family.
