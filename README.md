## About Me
I’m pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science at the University of Maryland, College Park, with minors in Math and Statistics. My technical proficiencies cover a broad range, comprising full-stack web development, mobile development, and machine learning. I'm particularly passionate about leveraging my skills to develop solutions with real-world impacts, crafted with an analytical and user-centric mentality. Always looking forward to new challenges and opportunities, I'm eager to apply my skills as a software engineer in a collaborative environment.

When I'm not coding, you can find me playing the guitar, reading, playing/watching sports (or a Bollywood movie), or just hanging out with friends and family.
